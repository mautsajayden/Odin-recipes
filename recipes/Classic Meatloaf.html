    <h1>Classic Meatloaf</h1>

    <p>This traditional meatloaf recipe made with saut√©ed vegetables, spices, 
        and bread crumbs is moist and flavorful and topped with an old-fashioned 
        glaze. Cook time will depend on the size and shape of your loaf, as well as 
        the type of baking pan you use. Serve this hearty meal on cool fall or winter 
        evenings with mashed potatoes and a simple mushroom gravy.
