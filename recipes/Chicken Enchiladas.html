    <h2> Directions </h2>
   
    <h3>Step 1 </h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

    <h3>Step 2 </h3>
    <p>Mix soup and sour cream in a small bowl; set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3 </h3>
    <p>Melt margarine in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and chili powder, 
        and sauté until tender. Stir in chicken, chile peppers, and 2 tablespoons of the soup 
        mixture. Cook and stir until heated through.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4 </h3>
    <p>Spread 1/2 cup of the soup mixture in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the 
        chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Roll up tortillas and place, seam-sides-down, 
        in the baking dish. Spoon remaining soup mixture on top, and sprinkle with cheese.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5 </h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.
